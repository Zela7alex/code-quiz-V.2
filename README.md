# code-quiz-V.2
An upgraded code quiz of code-quiz V.1 

A code quiz should not only test your skills but it should also be fun while you take it!

Code Quiz V.2 is an upgraded version of a code-quiz I did a few months ago. With better styling and refactored javascript. It is much easier to read and has a better ux/ui.

# Functionality
This is a simple quiz application that can be played by developers of all skill levels directly from a web browser.

 - The UI shows a set of questions and lets the user select an answer. 
 - If the user chooses correctly, their answer will show green. Otherwise it will show red. 
- The users overall score will accumulate and show on the high scores page. They may then enter their name to save their high score.
